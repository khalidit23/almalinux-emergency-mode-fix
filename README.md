## üîç Cause
- The **XFS log (journal)** on the root filesystem was corrupted.
- The system was using **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**, and `/sysroot` couldn't mount properly.
 

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fixing Emergency Mode

### Ô∏èIdentify the Root Partition (LVM)

Run:
```bash
blkid
```
### Execute the following command to repair XFS:
```bash
xfs_repair /dev/mapper/almalinux-root
```
If you‚Äôre unable to repair without clearing the journal, use the `-L` flag (this will clear the journal, and may cause data loss):

```bash
xfs_repair -L /dev/mapper/almalinux-root
```
üî¥ Warning: The `-L` flag clears the journal, which may cause recent data loss.

### Reboot the System

After the repair, reboot the system to check if it boots successfully:
```bash
reboot
```
